# Gesture-based-Video-Interaction-System
This program continuously captures video from the webcam, detects three hand gestures using MediaPipe, and displays a corresponding background video for each gesture. It also applies visual effects like blurring the background and converting part of the webcam frame to grayscale.

Features -
1. Real-time Gesture Detection: Utilizes MediaPipe's hand-tracking capabilities to recognize gestures like 'thumbs up', 'peace sign', and 'OK sign' in real-                                    time, making the system interactive and responsive.

2. Gesture-Triggered Video Playback: Different hand gestures automatically trigger the playback of corresponding background videos, creating a seamless                                              gesture-based control mechanism.

3. Dynamic Background Integration: Background videos are dynamically blended with the live webcam feed using image processing techniques, including Gaussian                                       blur, to create visually engaging interactions.

4. Custom Frame Processing: Parts of the live webcam feed (e.g., top 100 pixels) are selectively processed with grayscale effects, adding a layer of visual                                 enhancement to the user interface.

5. Efficient Video Reset and Playback: Includes functionality to reset video playback once a video ends, ensuring continuous interaction and smooth transitions                                         between gesture-triggered actions.

6. User-friendly Interface: The system provides a real-time visual display with smooth transitions between gesture-based actions, ensuring a seamless user                                  experience.

These features combine to create a responsive, visually appealing system where user gestures control video playback, demonstrating practical applications in interactive media and user interfaces.
